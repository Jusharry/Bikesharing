Most rides start in Manhattan which is the hub of the financial and entertainment district in NYC.

Being that we already know that most bikes are used for 5 minutes or less it should come as no surprise that the end locations are quite close to the start locations.

## Summary 
Based on the information gathered it is quite clear that the NYC Citi Bikesharing platform is very successful . There is a strong user base that while predominantly male is consistent throught all days of the week . I beliave that a similiar business model could be replicated in Des Moines without much trouble. 
It was also noted through further analysis that rides lasting longer that 5 minutes and up to an hour had a noticeable footprint outside of the Manhattan core as is demonstrated by the following images :
